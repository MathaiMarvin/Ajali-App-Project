          "description": "The families of 11 people who perished in a grisly road accident along Migori-Isebania road on April 8 have called out to the county government to clear the road to prevent future accidents. This is as the county held a requiem mass for the departed souls led by Rt Rev Capt Reuben Katite.According to the families, the death of their loved ones met them with shock as the Migori-Isebania road keeps reminding them of the bad accident that happened.The families which requested for walkways to be cleared for pedestrians to use said their departed relatives had left behind young families which still needed support.",
